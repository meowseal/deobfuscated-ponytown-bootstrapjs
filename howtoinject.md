This is just a simple script to enject it into the console
we can use tampermonkey to inject JS scripts onto sites
just put this in front of the script and change the name and save it to run it on the site
there'll be multiple files soon for changing parent directories but for now it doesn't work

```javscript
    // ==UserScript==
    // @name         Pony Town bootstrap override
    // @match        https://pony.town/*
    // @run-at       document-start
    // @grant        GM_xmlhttpRequest
    // ==/UserScript==
    

```
